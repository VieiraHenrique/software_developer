# Primitives vs Reference Types

---

We saw `primitives` store simpler data and `reference types` handle complex objects.

But there is a very important difference between these two categories regarding memory management.

#### Primitives

Look at this code :

```java
byte x = 1;
byte y = x;

System.out.println(x); // 1
System.out.println(y); // 1

// Now.. if we change x

x = 7;

System.out.println(x); // 7
System.out.println(y); // 1

```

You see ? `y` continues being 1.

Because each of these variables occupies a different space in memory.

Even tough we said at first that `y` would be `x`, we were still allocating two differents "slots". The "slot" `y` being the value that `x` held at this time.

Changing `x` didn't change the "slot" `y`.

#### Reference type

When we use reference type, this behaviour is different.

Look at this code :

```java
import java.awt.*; // This import everything from the awt package, where we can find the class Point that defines a point in two dimensions.

Point pointOne = new Point(5, 7);

Point pointTwo = pointOne;
```

When we create `pointOne`, we allocate a "slot" in memory for this point (which has the value `(5,7)` and an address in memory. Let's say : `1234`).

But also... it allocates yet another "slot" in memory for the variable named `pointOne`.

This "slot" for `pointOne` doesn't hold `(5,7)`. It holds `1234`.

So when we say `pointTwo` is equal to `pointOne`, `pointTwo` actually holds the **address** of the value `(5, 7)`

Ok...
Slow down...

Let's think like that :

Each row is a "slot" that occupies a space in memory.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>
                value
            </th>
            <th>
                address
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                (5,7)
            </td>
            <td>
                1234
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                pointOne → 1234
            </td>
            <td>
                (whatever...)
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                pointTwo → 1234
            </td>
            <td>
                (whatever...)
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

See ?
`pointOne` and `pointTwo` are just references that point to the address 1234 which holds the value `(5, 7)`

So...

If we say now :

```java
pointTwo = (3, 9); // not valid code. Just for the example

System.out.println(pointOne); // (3, 9)
```

In memory, only the value of the slot at `1234` changed.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>
                value
            </th>
            <th>
                address
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                (3, 9)
            </td>
            <td>
                1234
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                pointOne → 1234
            </td>
            <td>
                (whatever...)
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                pointTwo → 1234
            </td>
            <td>
                (whatever...)
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

That's how `reference types` work, my friends...

The variables `pointOne` and `pointTwo` occupy each one (small) slot in memory, pointing both to the value of yet another slot (bigger) in memory.

They are just... **references**.

This will defintely change the way we handle our variables depending on its value being primitives or references.
