# Multi-dimensional arrays

---

An array filled with other arrays... (2d arrays)

```java
int[][] numbers = new int[2][3]; // An array holding two arrays with 3 items each

numbers[1][0] = 5;

System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(numbers));

// [[0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0]]
```

- See we used `deepToString`? Try to do it with `toString` to see the result.
- Go look for why we use `deepToString` instead of `toString`.

We can also do a 3d array !

```java
int[][][] numbers = new int[4][2][3];
```

etc.

#### Curly braces way of doing it

```java
int [][] numbers = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };

System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(numbers));

// [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```
