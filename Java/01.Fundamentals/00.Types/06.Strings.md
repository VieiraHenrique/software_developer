# Strings

---

All righty then !

We all know `string` are an essential part of programming. We can't do without it !

However, we saw that `string` is not a primitive type as in other languages.

Indeed, `strings` are a reference type, thus : each string is an object instantiated from a class `String`.

```java
String myString = new String("Hello World");
```

Just one thing about strings : Even tough it's an object created from a class, and because it's such an important and common type, Java spares us of creating a `new String()`. We can just directly insert a string between quotes. We call that a `string literal`.

```java
String myString = "Hello World";
```

(by the way, if you try to use `new String()`, your IDE will tell you it's redondant)

Note that it's still an object. It contains then many methods that help us manipulating it :

```java
String myString = "Hello World";
myString.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO WORLD"
myString.toLowerCase(); // "hello world"
myString.isEmpty(); // false
myString.endWith('d'); // true
myString.indexOf('l'); // 2
```

You can check all the string methods [here](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_string.asp)

- Note that when you call a method, it doesn't mutate the original. It just represents a new value. If you dont assign it to anything, `myString` will still be `Hello World`.

About escaping characters, it's like many other languages : a back-slash `\`

If you want to escape a back-slash itself : double back-slash `\\`

There are other escapes... go look for them (tabs, new line, etc.)
