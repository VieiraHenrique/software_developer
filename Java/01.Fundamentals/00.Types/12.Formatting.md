# Formatting numbers

---

Often, we will have to format our numbers.

There is a class that has many methods to do this : `NumberFormat` that belongs to the `java.text` package.

(just a note : `NumberFormat` is an `abstract class`, which means we can't instantiate it. We'll see what abstract classes are later in the course.)

For now, you can call `NumberFormat` directly in your code. (using methods that create an instance themselves). So : the result is an object.

```java

import java.text.NumberFormat;

// ...

NumberFormat currency = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();

currency.format(5.799783); // 5.79 â‚¬

//////////

NumberFormat percent = NumberFormat.getPercentInstance();

percent.format(0.1); // 10%

// or... chaining methods like in JavaScript :

NumberFormat.getPercentInstance().format(2.3); // 230%
```

There are many and many formatting options. If you need a specifc one, Google is your friend ;)
