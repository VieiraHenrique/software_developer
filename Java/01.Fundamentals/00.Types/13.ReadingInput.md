# Reading input

---

Remember the `prompt` method in JavaScript ? We ask a value to the user and can store it into a variable.

There is such a thig in Java as well, but much more capable.

It's called `scanner`. An object that we instantiate from the class `Scanner`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

// ...

Scanner userInput = new Scanner(System.in);
```

The argument we give to this object is from where we will read the information. Here, we are saying it's the `System.in`. That means the console.

The object we created has many methods for reading data. All these methods start with `next`.

```java
Scanner userInput = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter your age ?");
byte age = userInput.nextByte();
System.out.println("You are " + age + " years old");
```

Ok!!!! We now have a way of interacting with the program UUUHAY !!! :D

Some points :

- You have to use the correct method depending on the input type you want `nextByte`, `nextFloat`, etc.

<br/>

- There is no such a thing as `nextString()`. You must use just`nextLine()`

```java
String name = userInput.nextLine().trim().toUpperCase();
```

(the `trim` and `toUpperCase` here are just to show you can chain it with any string method.)

<br/>

- You might have noticed that the program never ends. You must **close the scanner**. Find a way of closing it. (really dumb)
