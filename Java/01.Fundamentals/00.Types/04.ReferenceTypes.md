# Reference Types

---

We saw `primitive types`. These types are the building blocks of values in Java. They store simple values such as numbers, booleans and a single charater.

`reference types` are used to store complex objects such as dates, strings of characters, and actually... anything you want ! You can create the data type you want. Such as a `MailMessage`, `Cars`, etc.

Let's declare a variable that is, not a number, not a boolean... but a Date :

```java
package tutorial;

import java.util.Date;

public class MyProgram {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Date now = new Date();
		System.out.println(now);
	}
}
```

Look at this code. We have here a class (a program) called `MyProgram`, that belongs to the package `tutorial` (which I created).

In the entrypoint of this program (the method `main`), we declare a variable `now`.

However, we know Java is a typed language. So the variable `now` must be declared as a specific type.

A date is not a number, a boolean or a single character (it doesn't fit the primitive types). A date is a specific kind of value in the real world: a specific point in time...

But wait... there is class in the package `util` called `Date`! Each class can be kind of a "custom type". So we create a new object from this class and its type is the class itself (`Date`).

Ouuuuf...
Is that too complicated ?
On next chapter we will go a little further in this explanation.
