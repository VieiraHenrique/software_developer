# Variables

---

At this stage, of course, you know what a variable is : a placeholder for a value that behaves as the value it contains.

Remember Java is a typed language. Which means each time we declare a variable, we must specify what `data type` this variables will be.

So we first need to discuss `data type` !

There are eight **primitive data types** in Java. The other ones are **object references**. (We'll see what those are soon).

### Declaring variables

We must explicitely tell Java what kind of value (data type) we are storing.

`type name = value`

```java
int myNumber = 5;
boolean isBig = false;
// Etc...
```

**How to create constants ?**

We just declate the variable with a `final` before.

```java

final int myNumber = 5;

myNumber = 16; // ERROR ! 5 was the final variable value : a constant !
```

**Exercise**

- Create a little program that prints to the console how many degrees celsius is 70.3 Farenheit.
- The result in the console should be : `70.3°F is 21.27777777777778°C`
- You'll have to find the formula to convert °F to °C.
- You'll have to find a way to declare decimal numbers.
- You'll have to find a way to concatenate the text with variables you'll have created.

Java code :

```java
double farenheit = 70.3;
double result = (farenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;

System.out.println(farenheit + "°F is " + result + "°C");
```
