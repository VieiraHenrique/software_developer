# Final exercise : Mortgage simulator

---

Let's do a mortgage simulation program.

The program should :

- Ask the user the price of the house they want to buy.
- Ask the user the amount of money they already have and want to invest.
- Ask the user at what anual interest rate the loan will be done.
- Calculate the amount to be borrowed.
  - Notice that there is a tax to be paid of `12.5%` of the house price that has to be considered in the total cost of the project. (So : if the price of the house is 100.000, the total cost of the project will be 112.500)
- Calculate the amount of of the mortgage on a 25 years period.

Example of answer :

For a **500.000€** house at **3,08%** anual interest rate and an inital capital of **240.000€**, the mortagage will be : **1542,78€**

The program should display a message in the console as such :

```
YOUR MORTGAGE PROJECT
=====================
Price of the house : 500.000€
Taxes : 62.500€
Cost of the project with taxes : 562.500€
Initial capital : 240.000
Annual interest rate : 3,08%
Total loan : 322.500€
Monthly payment for 25 years : 1542,78€
Total reimbursement : 462.835,30€
=====================
```

(Respect all the correct formatting)

**Good to know :**

- All user inputs come as a string.

(if after you've done the program and have passed these inputs the answers are not the same, there is a problem... :o)
