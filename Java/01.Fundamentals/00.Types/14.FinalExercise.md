# Final exercise : Mortgage simulator

---

Let's do a mortgage simulation program.

The program should :

- Ask the user the following questions :

```
What is the price of the house you want to buy?

How much is the real estate tax in your region?

What's the amount of your initial capital?

What's the annual interest rate of your bank?

In how many years the loan will take place?

```

- Calculate the amount to be borrowed.
  - Notice that there is a tax to be paid based on the house price that has to be considered in the total cost of the project.
- Calculate the amount of the mortgage on the amount of years entered.

Use-case :

For a **500.000 €** house at **3,23%** anual interest rate and an inital capital of **220.000 €**, during **25 years**, and the tax being **3%**, the mortagage will be : **1.434,47 €**

The program should display a message in the console as such :

```
YOUR MORTGAGE PROJECT
=====================
Price of the house: 500.000,00 €
Taxes: 15.000,00 €
Cost of the project with taxes: 515.000,00 €
Initial capital: 220.000,00 €
Annual interest rate: 3,23%
Total loan: 295.000,00 €
Monthly payment for 25 years: 1.434,47 €
Total reimbursement :  430.340,41 €
=====================
```

- Respect all the correct formatting

- if after you've done the program and have passed these inputs the answers are not the same, there is a problem... :o

**Good to know :**

- All user inputs come as a string.
- Formula to calculate the monthly payment:

```
Monthly payment = (P * R * (1 + R) ^ N) / ((1 + R) ^ N - 1)
```

Where:

```
P is the loan amount
R is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12)
N is the total number of monthly payments
```
