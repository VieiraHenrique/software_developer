# Math class

---

In Java, we have this `Math` class that belongs to the package `java.lang`.

This class have has a number of useful methods.

```java
double x = Math.round(4.35);
```

"round" rounds it to a double (4.0) so you must put "double". You can check this hovering the "random" method in your IDE

If you want an integer you have to cast it to an integer. Pretty weird... :/

```java
int x = (int)Math.round(4.35);
```

Other methods :

```java
double x = Math.ceil(2.2); // 3
double x = Math.floor(2.89); // 2
int result = Math.max(4,9); // 9
int result = Math.max((int) 4.3, 9); // 9
```

Random number between 1 and 100;

```java
double x = Math.random() * 100 + 1;
```

Want to get rid of the decimals ? You could round it or cast it to an `int`:

```java
double x = Math.round(Math.random() * 100 + 1);
int y = (int)(Math.random() * 100 + 1);
```

Notice the `double`. That's the result type of math round. Always check on your IDE the input expected and the ouput.
