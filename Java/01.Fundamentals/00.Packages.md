# Packages

---

Every Java program will be organized by groups of classes that are going to interact with each other.

These "groups" are called `packages`.

Think of a folder with several classes inside of it. This "folder" is the `package` to which each class belong.

---

In our example :

```java
System.out.print("Hello World");
```

`System` is a class that belongs to the package `java.lang`.

`java.lang` being the "default" package for the Java language, we don't have to call it on top of our program. But for any use of classes of different packages, we will have to call the package :

```js
package mypackage;
```

That means we can now use the classes that belong to this package.
