# Packages

---

Every Java program is organized by groups of classes that interact with each other.

These "groups" are called `packages`.

Think of a folder with several java files inside (classes) of it. This "folder" is the `package` to which each class belong.

---

In our example :

```java
System.out.print("Hello World");
```

`System` is a class that belongs to the package `java.lang`.

`java.lang` being the "standard" package for the Java language, we don't have to call it on top of our program. But for any use of classes of different packages, we will have to call the package :

```js
import mypackage.MyClass;
```

That means we can now use the class (`MyClass`) you imported that belong to this package (`mypackage`).
