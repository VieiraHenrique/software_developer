# Packaging

---

Ooook... we're arriving at the last chapter of the **Fundamentals** unit.

Here, let's learn how to _package_ (deploy) a Java application so the user can open it without having to enter an IDE, open the project and launch it. We don't want the user to have access to our code. We only need the final terminal program.

That means, the user should open his terminal, launch the `.jar` file and the program will run.

We will be doing this with our Mortgage program.

For this chapter, I chose to do something a little different...

At BeCode, the aim is to learn how to learn.

That's why, for this chapter, I am not gonna give you any information. When I was learning I had plenty of errors when I tried to deploy my first project. (even watching some tutorials).

I had to ask the right questions in forums, ChatGPT, etc. in order to make it work.

Go ahead ! Deploy your mortgage program into a `.jar` file and launch it in a terminal !

Good luck, my friends !
