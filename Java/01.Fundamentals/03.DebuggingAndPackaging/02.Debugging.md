# Debugging

---

Debugging can become your best-friend when programming in Java.

There is a specifc button (or shortcut) for it.

The idea is simple : instead of running all your program at once, you can run it line by line, see the result and then manually go to the next line.

With this, you can clearly see exactly where your program gives an error or doens't behave as you expected.

[Here](https://youtu.be/aqcJsKdjjvU?si=buOaUcIg7GKYci6D) is a nice tutorial on how to use the debugger in Eclipse.

And [here]() is another one.

As always, you don't need to check the videos if you prefer to look for other ressources.

From this, try to debug this code in order to find the erros at run-time and correct them.

For that, you'll have to :

- Create a breakpoint in the beggining of your program. (you could create them in a specific part of the code, but here let's go through all the program)
- Go line by line to find the first error.
- Fix it
- Try again to run your program.
- Find the next error with the debugger
- Fix it.

(The errors are ridiculous. You could just directly see and fix them. But play the game: use the debugger ;) )

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        int myNumber = 5;
        int otherNumber = 4;
        int substraction = otherNumber - myNumber;
        int result = substraction + 1;

        System.out.println(5 / result);

        int[] myArr = { 5, 9, 2, 5 };

        System.out.println(myArr[4]);

        System.out.println("Goodbye World");
    }
}
```

Great ! As we are going to have bigger and bigger programs, you'll see that the debugger can be veeeeery useful !
