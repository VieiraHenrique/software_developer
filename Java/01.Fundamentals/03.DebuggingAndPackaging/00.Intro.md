# Intro : Debug and Packaging

---

In this section, we're gonna learn how to debug Java programs and also how to package it for deployment.

We are going to take a look on :

- Finding and fixing errors
- Types of errors
- Common errors that beginners encounter
- Debugging
- Packaging

## Errors

There are two types of error in Java :

- Compile-time errors
- Run-time errors

#### Compile-time errors

These errors happen when Java cannot be compiled due to an error in your code.

For example:

- You're trying to use a variable that hasn't been declared.
- You're assigning a value of the wrong type to a declared variable.
- You have a mispelling or no valid syntax. (you forgot to close a block, didn't put the `;` after a declaration, etc.)

Any error linked to your code that prevent Java to be compiled into Bytecode.

Usually, the error message you'll receive is pretty self-explanatory. It will tell you what is going on.

`someVariable cannot be resolved to a variable`, for example, will mean that the variable `someVariable` is used on your program but has not been declared. The program doesn't know what `someVariable` is.

#### Run-time errors

Run-time errors are more tricky.

Your code has no syntax or logical problem, and thus is rightly compiled, but when you try to run the program, there is something wrong.

Usually the message is more absctract and we can't necessarly know at first glance why this is.

In this case, Google is your friend ! Forums like Stackoverflow or others have plenty of infor
