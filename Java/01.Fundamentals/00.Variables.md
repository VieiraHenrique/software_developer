# Variables

---

At this stage, of course, you know what a variable is : a placeholder for a value that behaves as the value it contains.

Remember Java is a typed language. Which means each time we declare a variable, we must specify what kind of `data type` this variables will hold.

So we first need to discuss `data type` !

There are eight **primitive data types** in Java. The other ones are **object references**. (We'll see what those are soon).

Check this out :

| **Data type** | **size in memory** | **primitive / reference** | **value**                           |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **boolean**   | 1 bit              | primitive                 | true or false                       |
| byte          | 1 byte             | primitive                 | \-228 to 127                        |
| short         | 2 bytes            | primitive                 | \-32,768 to 32,767                  |
| **int**       | 4 bytes            | primitive                 | \-2 billion to 2 billion            |
| long          | 8 bytes            | primitive                 | \-9 quintillion to 9 quintillon     |
| float         | 4 bytes            | primitive                 | fractional number up to 6-7 digits  |
| **double**    | 8 bytes            | primitive                 | fractional number up to 15 digits   |
| **char**      | 2 bytes            | primitive                 | single character/letter/ASCII value |
| **String**    | varies             | reference                 | a sequence of characters            |

These are the caracteristics these data types have : the amount of space it takes on memory and the values it can hold.

The data types in **bold** are **most used ones** with which you'll spend most of your time. (so : `boolean`, `int`, `double`, `char` and `String`)

### Primitive vs Reference data types

| **Primitive**                 | **Reference**                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 8 types (boolean, byte, etc.) | unlimited (user defined)     |
| stores data                   | stores an address in memory  |
| can only hold 1 value         | could hold more than 1 value |
| uses less memory              | uses more memory             |
| faster                        | slower                       |

`reference type` is user defined. Which means, we can create any kind of data type we want and use it in a variable with the type we created. However, some reference data types already exist in the core utils package of Java, such as `String`, that we can use already.

Ultimately, a reference type is an adress to an object in memory. That means this object can have methods to be applied to the variable.

### Declaring variables

We must explicitely tell Java what kind of variable we are storing.

`type name = value`

```java
int myNumber = 5;
boolean isBig = false;
// Etc...
```

**How to create constants ?**

We just declate the variable with a `final` before.

```java

final int myNumber = 5;

myNumber = 16; // ERROR ! 5 was the final variable value : a constant !
```

**Exercise**

- Create a little program that prints to the console how many degrees celsius is 70.3 Farenheit.
- The result in the console should be : `70.3°F is 21.27777777777778°C`
- You'll have to find the formula to convert °F to °C.
- You'll have to find a way to declare decimal numbers.
- You'll have to find a way to concatenate the text with variables you'll have created.

Java code :

```java
double farenheit = 70.3;
double result = (farenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;

System.out.println(farenheit + "°F is " + result + "°C");
```
