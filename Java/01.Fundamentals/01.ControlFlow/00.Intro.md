# Control Flow : Introduction

---

Hellow there !
Let's tackle control flow in Java, shall we ?

Control flow is all about `conditions` and `loops`. We've seen this extensively in JavaScript already and... good news ! In Java (as almost all other high level languages) the syntax is not that different.

If the concepts of type in Java are quite different from JS, you should find your way pretty easily here.

#### What we are going to see ?

- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Conditions
- Loops

Good luck, my friends !
