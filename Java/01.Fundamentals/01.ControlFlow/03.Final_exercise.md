# Final exercise : revisiting our mortgage program.

---

Let's get back to the Mortgage program !

You can use the code you did and refactor it, or use your super-powers to write it again much more quickly now.

- For each input from the user (price of the house, etc.), implement an error handling.
  - So... The inputs must be numerical values (eligibe to be parsed as a number). You might have noticed that if you answered with `blabla` for example, the program would break with an error.
- For each error, you must print an error message and ask for the answer again.
- Make that no input is negative.
- Establish that the **house price** can only be between **1K** and **1M**.
- The **annual interest rate** should be maximum **30%**.
- The **years** should be maximum **25**.
- The **government tax** cannot be more than **12.5%**
- The **intital capital** cannot be less than **10%** of the price of the house.
- Also... create a new question : how much is the salary of the user (eventually combined with his partner) and print if he is eligible to get the loan. He can be eligible if his/their revenue is more than 1/3 of the monthly payment.

Great ! Or program is getting better ! :)
