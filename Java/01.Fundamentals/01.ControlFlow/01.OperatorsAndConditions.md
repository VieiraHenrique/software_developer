# Operators

#### Comparison operators

Nothing new here...

```java
8 == 8; // true
5 != 5; // false
3 > 2; // true
12 < 9; // false
```

have you noticed there is no `===` ? Of course ! `===` in JS aims to test if the types are equal, but in Java everything is already typed ! ;)

#### Logical operators

**AND operator**

```java
int temperature = 22;
boolean isWarm = temperature > 20 && temperature < 30; // true

// if temperature was 17 or 31 it would be false. Duhh...
```

**OR operator**

```java
int x = 5;
boolean isNotFive = x < 5 || x > 5; // false

// This example is ridiculous. We could just have made a comparison to know if it was not equal to 5. But you get it...
```

**NOT operator**

```java
// Testing if a person can become a politician in Belgium.
int age = 19;
boolean hasCriminalRecord = false;
boolean isBelgian = true;

boolean isEligible = age > 18 && isBelgian && !hasCriminalRecord; // true
```

---

So... basically... Nothing changes in comparison to JS !

---

# IF statements

---

```java
int temperature = 18;

if (temperature > 30) {
    System.out.println("It's a hot day. Drink plenty of water!");
} else if (temperature > 18 && temperature <= 30 ){
    System.out.println("This day is son nice!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Cold day. Take a coat !");
}

// "Cold day. Take a coat !"
```

You can also not write the curly braces in some cases. Personally I don't like it (may be because of my background in JS). But don't hesitate to use it if you think it "cleans" the code.

```java
int income = 200_000;
boolean hasHighIncome;

if (income > 100_000)
    hasHighIncome = true;
else
    hasHighIncome = false;
```

**Remember!** The concept of `scoping` also applies here. A variable declared inside a condition block cannot be accessed outside of it.

# Ternary Operator

---

Same old, same old...

```java
int score = 8;

String result = score > 12 ? "Great score ! Keep it up !" : "You must study a little more";
```

---

# Switch

---

```java
String role = "member";

switch (role) {
    case "admin" :
        System.out.println("You are an admin");
        break;
    case "member" :
        System.out.println("You are a member");
        break;
    case "visitor" :
        System.out.println("You are a visitor");
        break;
    default :
        System.out.println("No information about your role.")
}

// You are a member

```
