# Exercise : FizzBuzz

---

You already did this over and over...

But let's go ! This time in Java : make a program that prints all integers from 1 to a number that the user choses.

Each time it's a multiple of `3` it says `Fizz` and each time it's a multiple of `5` it says `Buzz`. When it's both, display `FizzBuzz`.
