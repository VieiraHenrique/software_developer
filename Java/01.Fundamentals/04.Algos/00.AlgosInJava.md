# Algos with Java

---

Let's practice Java with some algorithms. This will help you get familiar with the numerous native methods we have in Java.

Here is a list. Go nuts !

**How Many Solutions Does This Quadratic Have?**

A quadratic equation `a x² + b x + c = 0` has either 0, 1, or 2 distinct solutions for real values of `x`. Given `a`, `b` and `c`, you should return the number of solutions to the equation.

```
solutions(1, 0, -1) ➞ 2
// x² - 1 = 0 has two solutions (x = 1 and x = -1).

solutions(1, 0, 0) ➞ 1
// x² = 0 has one solution (x = 0).

solutions(1, 0, 1) ➞ 0
// x² + 1 = 0 has no real solutions.
```

**Array of multiples**

Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments `(num, length)` and returns an array of multiples of `num` until the array length reaches `length`.

```
arrayOfMultiples(7, 5) ➞ [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]

arrayOfMultiples(12, 10) ➞ [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]

arrayOfMultiples(17, 6) ➞ [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]
```

---

**Prime numbers in range**

Create a function that returns true if there's at least one prime number in the given range (`n1` to `n2` (inclusive)), false otherwise.

```
PrimeNumberInRange(10, 15) ➞ true
// Prime numbers in range: 11, 13

PrimeNumberInRange(62, 66) ➞ false
// No prime numbers in range.

PrimeNumberInRange(3, 5) ➞ true
// Prime numbers in range: 3, 5
```

Notes :

- `n2` is always greater than `n1`.
- `n1` and `n2` are always positive.
- 0 and 1 aren't prime numbers.
- Give a message if the inputs don't respect these conditions.

---

**Calculator**

Create a function that takes two numbers `a` and `b` and an operator. The function should return the result of the corresponding mathematical function on both numbers. If the operator is not one of the specified characters +, -, /, \*, or if there is a division by zero, the function should return null.

Look at the examples below to get an idea of what the function should do:

```
basicCalculator(2, '+',  4) ➞ 6

basicCalculator(6, '-', 5) ➞ 1

basicCalculator(12, '/', 3) ➞ 4

basicCalculator(3, '*', 4) ➞ 12

basicCalculator(1, '/', 0) ➞ null
// Division by zero is not possible

basicCalculator(1, 'x', 0) ➞ null
// 'x' is not an operator
```

---

**Number of digits**

Create a function that counts the integer's number of digits.
Try to not use strings.

```
count(4666) ➞ 4

count(544) ➞ 3

count(318) ➞ 3

count(-92563) ➞ 5

count(-314890) ➞ 6

count(654321) ➞ 6

count(638476) ➞ 6
```

---

**Rock, Paper, Scissors**

Create a function which simulates the game "rock, paper, scissors". The function takes the input of both players (rock, paper or scissors), first parameter from first player, second from second player. The function returns the result as such:

- "Player 1 wins"
- "Player 2 wins"
- "TIE" (if both inputs are the same)

The rules of rock, paper, scissors, if not known:

- Both players have to say either "rock", "paper" or "scissors" at the same time.
- Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beat paper.

```
rps("rock", "paper") ➞ "Player 2 wins"

rps("paper", "rock") ➞ "Player 1 wins"

rps("paper", "scissors") ➞ "Player 2 wins"

rps("scissors", "scissors") ➞ "TIE"

rps("scissors", "paper") ➞ "Player 1 wins"
```

---

**Consecutive numbers**

Create a function that determines whether elements in an array can be re-arranged to form a consecutive list of numbers where each number appears exactly once.

```
cons([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]) ➞ true
// Can be re-arranged to form [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

cons([5, 1, 4, 3, 2, 8]) ➞ false

cons([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9]) ➞ false
// 9 appears twice
```

---

**Palindrome**

Create a recursive function that determines whether a word is a palindrome or not.

```
isPalindrome("madam") ➞ true

isPalindrome("adieu") ➞ false

isPalindrome("rotor") ➞ true
```

Note : All inputs are in lowercase. Check if it's the case.

---

**Remove repeated characters**

Create a function that will remove any repeated character(s) in a word passed to the function. Not just consecutive characters, but characters repeating anywhere in the string.

```
unrepeated("teshahset") ➞ "tesha"

unrepeated("hello") ➞ "helo"

unrepeated("aaaaa") ➞ "a"

unrepeated("WWE!!!") ➞ "WE!"
```

---

**Numbered cards**

You have a pack of 5 randomly numbered cards, which can range from 0-9. You can win if you can produce a higher two-digit number from your cards than your opponent. Return `true` if your cards win that round.

```
winRound([2, 5, 2, 6, 9], [3, 7, 3, 1, 2]) ➞ true
// Your cards can make the number 96
// Your opponent can make the number 73
// You win the round since 96 > 73

winRound([2, 5, 2, 6, 9], [3, 7, 3, 1, 2]) ➞ true

winRound([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [9, 8, 7, 6, 5]) ➞ false

winRound([4, 3, 4, 4, 5], [3, 2, 5, 4, 1]) ➞ false
```

Return false if you and your opponent reach the same maximum number (see example #4).
