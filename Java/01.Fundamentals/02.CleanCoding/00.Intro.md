# Intro to clean coding

---

Well helloooow !

After the last exercise (Mortgage program), you might have noticed that your code was getting pretty big, and most of all : repetitive !

This compromises the code readability and hurts the maintainability of the program.

This is why having a clean and efficient code is a must in programming !

Breaking our code in smaller chunks, easy to read, reusable and easy to read and understand are the best way to clean our code.

Let's take a look on strategies we can adopt to make it happen, shall we ?

In this section, we'll see :

- Methods
- Refactoring
- Extracting methods
- Repetitive patterns

See you in the other side ;)
