# Refactoring

---

**Refactoring** means : Changing the structure of the code without changing its behavior.

It's not exactly what you've done last time in the mortgage program because you were adding functionnalities.

Refactoring doesn't change the program behavior. It just changes its structure.

Take a rule of thumb : a method ideally has between **5 and 10 lines of code**. No longer than **20** !

Take a look at your mortgage program. I am sure there are at least 40 lines... BAD, BAD, BAD !

Think of things we could extract from the mortgage program.

I am thinking of some things...

- The way we ask questions to the user (a loop with conditions, etc.) is very repetitive.
  - Why can't we make a method that only receives the right arguments and perform the same taks each time ?
    <br/>
- Calculating the monthly payment

  - This doesn't repeat, but it's a good piece of logic that could be used by other programs later
    <br/>

- Separate the output message and other parts from the main method.
  - So in the main method we basically have a pattern like the instructions for our program line by line:
  ```java
      askQuestions(arguments...);
      calculateMortgage(arguments...);
      outputMessage(arguments...);
      // etc.
  ```

just a few ideas...

**Exercise**:

- From these three suggestions, refactor your mortgage program using new methods.

Good luck !
