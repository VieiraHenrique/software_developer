# Methods

---

From your practice in JS, you know already what methods are :

"Functions that belong to a class and can be executed, either from the class itself if it's `public` and `static`, either from an object intantiated from the clas
s"

By the way, we've been dealing with a method this whole time : the `main` method : a function inside our class that is the entry point for our program.

As you might have thought about, we can create other methods inside of our class, that we can use in our main method to facilitate its implementation.

```java
package training;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is the main method, from which our program will start.
        greetUser("Henrique", "Vieira");
    }

    public static void greetUser(String firstName, String lastName){
        System.out.println("Hello" + firstName + " " + lastName + "!!!");
    }
}
```

It's the same logic that when we learned about functional programming in JS.

We create functions (that can receive parameters) that are gonna execute a specific task.

The only specificity here is that everything happens inside of a class as methods. Otherwise, it's the same logic.

(We will get deeper into `classes`, `methods`, `public`, `private`, `static`, `void`, etc when we'll tackle **Object Oriented Programming**)

By the way... we can already tackle `void`...

`void` means that the method doesn't return anything. But if we want it to return something, we write the type instead of `void` :

```java
package training;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is the main method, from which our program will start.
        String message = greetUser("Henrique", "Vieira");
        System.out.println(message);
    }

    public static String greetUser(String firstName, String lastName){
        return "Hello" + firstName + " " + lastName + "!!!";
    }
}
```
