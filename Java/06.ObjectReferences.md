# Object References

---

### What object reference means ?

Object is an instance of a class.

It is stored somewhere in the memory and reference is used to point to that memory location where that object is stored.

You don't have to handle it.

Java will do it for you and uses the object name to get the object.

You can create almost unlimited amount of objects from a class (limited by your memory).

You can create an object from a class a such :

```java
ClassName objectName = value;
```

or :

```java
ClassName objectName = new ClassName(); // Eventually with parameters
```

### Methods and dot notation

As you should know already, you can create functions inside a class (called `methods`) and you can call them from an object with the dot notation, as you would with JavaScript.

```java
MyClass my = new MyClass(); // Here, we created an instance of the class MyClass called my

my.myMethod(); // Here, we are calling from the object my the method myMethod
```
