# Installing Java

---

In order to run a program in Java, we need to install the JDK (Java Development Kit) on your machine.

This JDK will be uses by your IDE to run Java code.

[Here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) is the link download it.

We will be working here with the version 17, so I ask you to install this one. Java is constantly being updated, improving capabilities of the language.

I advise you to check the differences between the different version and to not download a version too old, otherwise you would miss some key features we will tackle here.

#### Some considerations on different Java version.

- **Focus on smaller, frequent updates**: Newer releases (Java 11 onwards) tend to introduce fewer features at a time, but more frequently (every 6 months) compared to the pre-Java 11 days. This allows for faster iteration and adoption of new ideas.

- **Performance improvements**: Garbage collection has seen advancements, with options like G1 for reduced pause times and ZGC (introduced in Java 11) for ultra-low latency scenarios. (we will understand this later, don't worry :P)

- **Security updates**: Since Java 8 is no longer getting free public updates, it's recommended to use a later LTS (Long-Term Support) version like Java 11 or newer for better security.

Don't worry if you still don't know what those things are. ;)

#### Where to write code with Java ?

As you know by now, writing code can be done in any text editor. But of course, we will do it in an IDE, that comes with syntax highlighting, autocompletition (intelliSense), code refactoring, importing librairies, building, compiling, and running code.

The most used IDEs for Java programming are [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (from JetBrains and it's **not** free) and [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipseide.org/). However, you can use the IDE of your choice, for example : **VS Code**, which is free and open source and have a premade package to be installed specifically designed to program in Java.

I'll be using **Eclipse** in this course and I advise you to use it as well.

Ok... I know there are a lot of words and expressions in this document that we never heard before. **Don't worry!** We will make sense of all of this ! For now, just install everything mentioned below.

Now...

- Go look for **how to create a Java Project** in Eclipse and create your first project named `HelloWorld`.
- (Don't run it with any modules for now)
