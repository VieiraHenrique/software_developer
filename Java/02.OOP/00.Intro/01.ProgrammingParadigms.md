# Programming Paradigms

---

Programmings paradigms are **not** different languages.

It's the **way we program**. In any language.

Some languages were designed to be written in a specific way. But most of them allow you to _chose_ how you will program.

Java for example, is clearly designed to work with OOP.

There are several "schools of thought" on how we should program.
