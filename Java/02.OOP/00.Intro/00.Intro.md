# Introduction to the OOP section

---

Helloooooow my friends !

You just completed the **fundamentals** section for Java. Things are gonna get more serious now.

You've already noticed that Java is mainly an **Object Oriented** language.

Not "strictly" because of : primitive data types, static members, etc... but object-oriented concepts play a central role in Java programming.

In this section of the course, you'll learn and practice what is **OOP** (Object Oriented Programming), how it works and how to leverage it to write Java code.

But before that, we must first get to know what **programming paradigms** are and the **benefits of OOP**.

That's what we are going to do in the next chapters.
