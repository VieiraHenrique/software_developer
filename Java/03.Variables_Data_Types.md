# Variables

---

By now you should already know what is a variable (come on !).

So here and in the next chapters that intoduce basic concepts like variables, data types, operators, loops, control flow, etc. will be just a way of showing how it is done in Java. No much explanation about what it is will be presented.

### How to declare a variable in Java ?

Different from other languages where we have a specific keyword for declaring variables (think of `let`, `const`, `var`, `$`, etc.), in Java we declare a variable by typing first the datatype then the name of this variable :

```java
int myNumber = 5;

// You can also declare a variable without assigning any value to it :

int myOtherNumber;

// This variable is created but has no value. Later you can assign something to it but, of course, it will have to be an integer.

myOtherNumber = 7;
```

### Data types

There are two groups of data types in Java : `primitives` and `object references`.

Here is a sumup of the data types that exist. In the next chapters we will see how to use them.

#### Primitives

- **Whole numbers**

```java
// Default keyword :
int
// Other keywords more specific :
byte
short
long
// These specific keywords aim to establish the type of number the variable will hold
```

- **Floating point numbers**

```java
// Default keyword :
double
// Other keyword :
float
```

- **Two states: TRUE or FALSE**

```java
// Default keyword :
boolean
```

- **Single character**

Only **ONE** character. Like : "A", "5", "$", etc.

```java
// Default keyword :
char
```

#### Object references

- **Whole numbers**

```java
Byte
Short
Integer
Long

// They all start with uppercase because they are actually calling a class.
```

- **Floating point numbers**

```java
Float
Double
```

- **Two states: TRUE or FALSE**

```java
Boolean
```

All of the above are pretty similar to the primitives. The one that really interests us here is :

- **Text typs**

```java
Character
String
// String is a chain of characters, as you would have in any other language
```

- **Built-in and custom**

```java
// Built-ins...
System
FileWriter
// etc.

// Customs could be :
BlueWhale
ATMMachine
// etc.
```

Some other stuff :

- Variable names are **case sensitive** (`myvariable` is not the same as `myVariable`)
- Variables can't be declared two times with the same name in the same class or method.
- Variables names must start with a letter, or `$`, or `_` (not recommended)
- Variable names can't be a reserved keyword. (Java will tell you if you use one, so don't worry.)
- Variable names in Java are usually `camelCase`.

Let's tackle data types. Exercises are coming soon ! Don't worry ! ;)
