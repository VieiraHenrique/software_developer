# What is an Algorithm?

---

**Algorithms are a sequence of steps to be followed in order to solve a problem.**

Think of a cooking recipe.

- Problem : I want to make a cake.
- Steps :
  - Gather ingredients
  - Preheat oven
  - Mix dry ingredients
  - Cream butter and sugar
  - Beat in eggs one at a time
  - Alternate dry and wet ingredients
  - Pour batter into pan
  - Bake until a toothpick inserted comes out clean

Let's reflect on it...
These steps have some characteristics...

- They must be done in a specific order (Some can be done in parallel, that's true... but usually you can only do one thing at the time) --> One leads to another.
- For each of these steps, we could break it into many other little steps. --> "_mix dry ingredients_" could be :
  - Take flour
  - Put it in a bowl
  - Take spoon
  - Mix it with the spoon..
  - etc.

This makes us realize :

**In order to solve a problem, we follow a step by step sequence of operations composed of several smaller problems.**

#### Repetition

Many times, in a step by step problem solution, we will need to perform the same thing some times.

Let's think of a veeeery simple step-by-step sequence : a manager in a company goes to his office and has to sign and send many contracts. Here is a possible sequence for that :

- Get to the office's kitchen
- Make a coffee
- Go to his office
- Grab all the contracts in a pile
  - Sign contract 1
  - Sign contract 2
  - Sign contract 3
  - etc.
- Put the contracts in the "signed contract" shelf.

Great... There is something quite interesting here... See that he has to sign several contracts ? Let's imagine he has a todo list for every step. Will he put in his todo list "Sign contract 1", then "Sign contract 2", etc. etc. ?

No ! He will just put "Sign all contracts" !

But there is a repetition here. So the next step will be in "hold" untill all the repetition is done. This is what we call a **loop**.

Here, the condition to stop signing contracts is when it's there is no more contract to be signed.

But we could also say : "Today, I am gonna sign 10 contracts only." (he'll do the rest tomorrow for example)

We can use loops to do this in these two different ways.

#### Conditional

We can also have **decision making**.

Let's think of another situtation :

A teacher is grading an exam and has to encode "approved" or "failed" in her computer.

This is a condition. Where the outcome might be different depending on some situation.
