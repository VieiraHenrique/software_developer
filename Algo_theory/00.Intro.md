# Concept of Algorithm

---

Data structure and Algorithms are the two foundamental pieces of any programming language.

#### Data Structure

Imagine a toolbox. A data structure in programming is like a tray in that toolbox, designed to hold specific tools (data) in an organized way so you can easily find and use them (access the data) when needed.

#### Algorithm

An algorithm in programming is like a recipe. It's a set of step-by-step instructions that tell the computer exactly what to do to solve a problem, just like a recipe tells you how to cook a dish.
